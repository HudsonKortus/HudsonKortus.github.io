The high power rocket club (HPRC) builds a rocket and payload every year to compete at the Spaceport America Cup. The rocket is tasked with flying a payload to exactly 10,000 ft and the payload can have just about any mission we choose. This year the payload was a 10x10x70 cm steerable parachute lander.

After the rocket launched and its parachutes opened, the payload would eject away from the rest of the rocket and fall under its own special parachute. The payload is capable of pulling in, or reefing, the parachute lines which deformed the parachute, creating some lift, allowing the payload to steer. An on board camera which is stowed during flight, flips out and looks at the ground after the payload ejects. The camera uses computer vision to find a clear location for the payload to land, and then relayed that GPS location to the control system which stears the payload to the location.

This year the payload was a 10x10x70 cm steerable parachute lander.

The payload is capable of pulling in, or reefing, the parachute lines which deformed the parachute, creating some lift, allowing the payload to steer.

<h3>My Role:</h3>
I led the Payload Recovery team, a group of 7 people in charge of developing and testing the parachute, and building the system to eject the parachute. As the Payload Recovery lead I taught the team, composed primarily of first years, the basics of SolidWorks, designing for manufacturability, and static analysis of assembly. As a team we performed in depth research into parachute dynamics to choose the ideal parachute and then designed and built parachute test stands. We also resewed parachute lines to make it controllable and handled parachute packing and ejection electronics and energetics. 


In the Spring I took over as the entire Payload Division lead, taking charge of the entire payload project. I worked with over 50 people to integrate the separate payload subsystems together, picked up slack and projects that got left behind, and coordinated testing and design requirements with the rocket and program divisions.

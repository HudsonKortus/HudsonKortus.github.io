I am a junior Robotics Engineering student at WPI with significant hands-on and industry experience. I have worked two summers as a Robotics and Automation R&D Co-op with TTM Technologies, a premier domestic circuit board manufacturer. I have also worked for 1.5 years in a full-stack web internship with an award-winning educational nonprofit, where I maintained and expanded educational resources. In my classes, I have developed mapping, pathfinding, and localization algorithms using ROS, enabling a TurtleBot to map and navigate a maze. I have calculated and implemented inverse kinematics for a 5-DOF robotic arm, allowing it to pick up and sort balls. Additionally, I conducted cutting-edge research on the viability of pellet 3D printing with ultra-soft materials, enabling 3D-printed structures with shore hardness as low as 0030A.

Robotics engineering stands at the intersection of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science. This highly interdisciplinary education uniquely positions me to design systems with a comprehensive understanding of the mechanical, electrical, and software implications of my decisions. I can seamlessly bring a concept from an initial sketch through design, manufacturing, coding, and deployment. This makes me an agile and versatile full-stack product engineer, capable of everything from designing and analyzing custom linkage systems to building complex deep learning models for sensor perception.

My dream is to engineer positive solutions to climate change. I want to spend my life making the world better by using my engineering skills to help the environment. My interdisciplinary education and experience place me in an excellent position to think outside the box and develop innovative solutions.
